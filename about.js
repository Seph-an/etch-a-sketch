<h3>Drawing</h3>
<p>Moving the cursor around the <b>sketch-pad</b> will leave a pixelated
trail on the spot which the cursor has touched. The pixelated trail is 
owing to randomly generated colors which paint the specific points.<br><br>
Each point painted as the cursor moves is done so with a hue strength 
of 10%, to attain the full color, the cursor needs to be moved in-and-out 
of the spot of interest 10 times; each time the color gets 10% stronger.
</p><br>
<h3>Clear</h3>
<p>There is a means to clear the sketching area and start on a plain
canvas, this is done by clicking the <b>clear</b> button towards the top
right corner.</p><br>
<h3>More sketching space</h3>
<p>The default sketching area is 16 by 16 cells. However, you can choose
the size of your 'sketch-pad' by clicking on the <b>More sketching space?</b>
 link on the navigation panel (top of page) where you'll be presented by 
 an input interface to key in your desired grid size. <br><br> The input
  only accepts numbers which must be a number between 10 - 100. 
  You need to only enter one number as the system automatically uses
   the same number for both the row and column size hence a sketch area of 'row by column'.</p>
