# A project about divs designed in such a way that they can be used as a sketch pad of some sort, when a cursor hovers over the grids, they change color ever so slightly, each time the color geting stronger by a factor of 10% till it is 100% strong. The user should be able to determine the size of the 'sketch pad' the want e.g if they enter '30', they'll get a '30by30' grid to work with, if '64', a '64by64' grid or 'sketch pad' is generated.
